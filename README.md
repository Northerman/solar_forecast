# Solar Irradiance Forecasting Project:
* Predicting solar irradiance is a very important topic in energy generation. Predictions help plant managers forecast the amount of enery generated by solar cells resulting in a
lower production cost by reducing electricity generation from coal or natural gas.
* In this project we predict a short-term solar irradiance forecasting (3 hours ahead).
* We perform a unique train/validation/test splitting to adjust for seasonality as shown
* Here are some of the highlighted images from our analysis & predictions.
